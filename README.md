# Personalized Zodiac Insights Visualization
## Introduction
This project focuses on examining the relationship between Zodiac signs, perceptions of social media influencers, and the impact of social media on shopping behaviors. The analysis is based on two datasets provided by Adam Halper, which can be found at the following links:
## Datasets
1. Social Influence on Shopping: https://data.world/ahalps/social-influence-on-shopping
2. Online Influencer Marketing: https://data.world/ahalps/online-influencer-marketing

## Goal
The primary goal of this research is to explore if there are any similarities or differences between Zodiac signs in terms of their preferences and perceptions of social media influencers and how these preferences influence their shopping behaviors.

## Visualization

The project features an interactive sunburst chart that presents the data in a hierarchical structure, making it easy to explore and analyze the relationships between the variables. The chart allows users to navigate through different layers of data, providing insights into the preferences and behaviors of each Zodiac sign and their respective groups.

## Features

Interactive sunburst chart for easy exploration of the data
Personalized visualization toolbar allowing users to filter and customize the chart
Colorblindness-friendly color options
Dynamic text size and style adjustments for improved accessibility
Detailed tooltips displaying specific information for each data point
Preprocessing and Data Transformation
The datasets have undergone preprocessing and transformation to create a suitable hierarchical structure for the sunburst chart. This includes filtering relevant rows, combining similar answers, and recalculating percentages for each group. The final JSON file consists of a depth-based structure that represents Zodiac signs, Zodiac groups, preferences, and answer types.

## Acknowledgements

I would like to express my gratitude to Adam Halper for providing the two datasets that have been instrumental in this research. These datasets have contributed significantly to the analysis and understanding of the relationship between Zodiac signs, social media influencers, and shopping behaviors.
